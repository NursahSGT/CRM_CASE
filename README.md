# CRMcase

Hello,

The study you'll be looking at was conducted in the context of customer segmentation. I want to talk about the data first. I made three tables with customer, order, and category data for the segmentation study and shared them as marketing.csv.

In my job, I often choose PostgreSQL, and by setting up a Python sql connection, I can simply import tables and views. These three tables are also used to generate the marketing.csv data, which contains data on customer_id, TatolSales, OrderCount, and AvgOrderValue. I am unable to release the raw data due to privacy concerns, but I can confirm that it is standard e-commerce data. For your consumer segmentation study, you can develop your model by dividing your data into these four columns.

In the final step, I included the order.csv table to gather data on the industry the generated clusters were purchasing in.

I'm hoping the model I developed would give you excellent accuracy ratings.


Question
"The goal of this case study is to carry out the desired investigations by utilizing sales and customer-based data from a company operating in the E-Commerce industry during a specific time period. The data is hidden and not from the real world."
